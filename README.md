## Mission Statement

Managing diabetes is a relentless, 24/7 task. GlycoSync is an intelligent, adaptive mobile application designed to transform this daily challenge into a guided, empowering, and personalized journey. Our mission is to leverage the power of AI to learn from each user's unique body and lifestyle, providing proactive guidance to help them achieve better health outcomes and a greater sense of control.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 AI-Powered Personalization:** Generates a unique meal and lifestyle plan based on the user's profile, goals, and ongoing data.
* **🎯 Gamified Daily Tasks:** A simple, engaging interface that guides the user through daily goals for nutrition, exercise, and monitoring.
* **🔄 Dynamic Feedback Loop:** The AI analyzes daily reports to find patterns and automatically adapts the next day's plan to continuously optimize for better glucose control.
* **📸 OCR Report Scanner:** An integrated tool to scan physical lab reports and digitize the data effortlessly.
* **💬 AI Chatbot & Community:** Instant support through an intelligent chatbot and a space for users to connect and share experiences.
* **📊 Visualized Progress:** Delivers nightly and weekly reports with clear, easy-to-understand visualizations, helping users connect their actions to outcomes.
* **📚 Educational Resources:** A curated library of videos and guides to empower users with knowledge about their condition.

## ⚙️ How It Works: The Log → Analyze → Adapt Cycle

GlycoSync operates on a simple yet powerful daily feedback loop:

1.  **Log:** The user easily logs their meals, glucose readings, and activities throughout the day via an intuitive interface.
2.  **Analyze:** At night, our AI engine analyzes this data to understand the cause-and-effect relationships for that specific user. It identifies what caused glucose spikes and what helped stabilize them.
3.  **Adapt:** The plan for the next day is automatically and subtly refined based on the analysis, creating a continuously improving path to better health.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Planned)

* **Frontend:** Flutter
* **Backend:** Python (for AI/ML)
* **Database:** Firebase
* **AI/ML:** TensorFlow / PyTorch
* **OCR:** Google Vision API
